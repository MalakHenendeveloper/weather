🚀 Weather App

Weather App is a Flutter application designed to display live weather data and provide weather predictions using an external API. The app uses GetIt for dependency injection and Geolocator to fetch the user's location. It follows Clean Architecture to ensure a scalable and organized codebase. The app also utilizes Bloc/Cubit for efficient state management, providing both current weather information and forecasts for the upcoming days.
